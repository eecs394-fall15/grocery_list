#Potluck EECS 394

##Description
This application gives you an easy way to create lists of items to buy and share them with your friends and family. Whether it's a grocery list or planning out your next party, Potluck has you covered!

###Installation Instructions

###Building and Deploying the App

Mac: In terminal, navigate to the directory where the grocery_list is downloaded. Type "steroids deploy". A link will be generated which can be shared.

###Platform Requirements
The app can be built and modified on any version of Mac or Windows that is supported by Steroids.
The last version of Steroids that we ran our app with was v4.1.21
We did all of our testing for the app on iOS 8 and 9, and there is no guarantee that it will work on any version of Android.

###Known Issues
•When running the app on a phone that is connected via LTE (as opposed to wifi) there can be issues with uploading photos to the database.

•If multiple users try to commit to the same item simultaneously, there is no assurance as to which one will go through to the database. Sometimes the database will receive a null value in this case

•Android is currently unsupported
